    The F5 Common Controller Core Library (CCCL) is an orchestration package

    diverse environments (e.g. Marathon, Kubernetes, OpenStack).  The
    API will allow a user to create proxy services by specifying the:
    virtual servers, pools, L7 policy and rules, and monitors  as a service
    description object.  Each instance of the CCCL is initialized with
    namespace qualifiers to allow it to uniquely identify the resources
    under its control.
